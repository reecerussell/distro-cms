# Users Service

This API handles all operations around the identity of users, i.e. users, roles, claims, etc. The implementation is similar to .NET Identity, hence some implementations seem almost identical, but Identity has not been used due to it having code that is not needed, such as, the IdentityUser, UserManagers etc.
